			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15" title="Maxpedition Jumbo Versipack Black" src="http://www.smullinsupply.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/versipack-300x225.jpg" alt="Maxpedition Jumbo Versipack Black" width="300" height="225" />This Fatboy Versipack is another fine product of Maxpediton Hard Use Gear. This bag is one of the smaller in Maxpedition&#8217;s Versipack line of bags. For being the smaller in this lineup it&#8217;s definitely not lacking in features or packing space. I hear it all the time from my wife, calling it my man-purse&#8230;but that&#8217;s fine, because it&#8217;s one hell of a man-purse. But in fact, it looks like just another shoulder bag and nothing like a purse (I hope).</p>
<p>Where you can get one:</p>

<p><span id="more-14"></span></p>
<p>This pack/bag is designed to be slung diagonally over the shoulder on the right side of the body for those that are right handed. It can be used on the left side of the body just as easily and I believe it&#8217;s just the placement of the pouches that makes it better for use on the right side. For example&#8230;the pistol magazine pouch is toward the front of the pack when it&#8217;s worn on the right side for easy access when reloading. Speaking of reloading, this pack can be used as an everyday pack to carry smaller and medium sized items for a few hours out away from the house or camp, it can be used as a survival kit or bug-out type bag, or it can be used as a concealed carry bag to hold your pistol, mags, knife or other gear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start off with the materials. This bag is made of 1000 denier abrasion resistant ballistic nylon which is coated with a Teflon fabric protection to help with stain resistance and clean-up. The material is triple polyurethane coated on the inside for even more water resistance. The webbing is extremely durable nylon webbing and the nylon thread is stronger and thicker than your typical thread used for a bag. You can tell this just by looking at the stitching. There are no loose threads either, which shows better quality and tends to prevent the stitching from coming loose. The zippers are YKK and the buckles are UTX-Duraflex nylon buckles which are supposed to be quieter than normal buckles. They do seem quieter to me, however, they aren&#8217;t completely silent.</p>
<p>On the right side of the main pocket is what can be best described as a pistol magazine pouch. This pouch can be used for multi-tools, knives, or anything else that&#8217;ll fit, but it is designed for a magazine. There is plenty of velcro to fit any magazine type and easily fits double stack mags. The flap for the mag pouch is adjustable via velcro, or can be completely removed if wanted.</p>
<p>To the left of the main pocket is another zip closed pocket that is perfect for a digital camera. That is what I put here most times. On the outside of that pocket are yet more MOLLE/PALS/ALICE attachment points where I keep a grimloc carabiner.</p>
<p>This pack has so many uses, it&#8217;s almost unlimited. I use it when I&#8217;m going out from camp for a while or on a hike to carry bug repellent, bottled water, digital camera, pistol, cell phone, etc, etc. This has tactical and recreational purposes. Instead of carrying tons of extras in my cargo pockets I now carry it all in the fatboy. I have found that this pack is extremely durable and will take whatever you can dish out to it. Maxpedition gear really is for hard use.</p>
<p>Colors: Tan, OD, Black, Foliage, ACU digital camo</p>
