<p>It may be the dead of winter, but why not start passing the time by planning for warmer weather and springtime pursuits?  <a href="http://www.smullinsupply.com/fiskars-phone-and-garden-pocket">The Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket</a> is a great new gardening accessory that you can start playing with now, even before the snow melts.  With it&#8217;s snazzy multi-pocket design and adjustable belt, the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket can provide you with the perfect excuse to dust off your gardening toys and play a little. You will be both surprised and impressed by how much the pockets can carry: <a href="http://www.smullinsupply.com/gardening/fiskars-softouch-polished-aluminum-trowel">trowels</a>, <a href="http://www.smullinsupply.com/gardening/fiskars-power-lever-grass-shears">shears</a>, gloves, <a href="http://www.smullinsupply.com/gardening/fiskars-powergear-anvil-pruner">pruners</a> &#8211; the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket turns a run-of-the-mill planting enthusiast into a superhero gardener.  Seriously.  You feel prepared for anything, even while there&#8217;s still two feet of snow on the ground.<span id="more-46"></span></p>

<p>Maybe the best feature of all, however, is the &#8220;phone&#8221; part of Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket.  Now you can go out to the garden, and bring the rest of the world to you &#8211; no more running back inside to take calls or check messages.  And since the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket has an adjustable belt, you can keep the phone close to you, where it won&#8217;t get dirty but also won&#8217;t be in the way.  The phone pocket is big enough to fit a cordless home phone, but cell phones fit right in, as well.  And I feel like it&#8217;s worth noting that if you use your imagination, the other pockets on the Fiskars Phone and Garden pocket can be used for a lot more than just gardening tools.  Bring gardening into the 21st century by slipping your Mp3 player in there.  Pack a notebook and <a href="http://www.smullinsupply.com/fisher-space-pens-black-rubberized-policepro-pen-ppro">pen</a> so you can make observations and take some notes.  If you pack the necessities, the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket could let you stay in the garden for hours.  Hey, if you had two Fiskars Phone and Garden Pockets, you could probably just live in the garden!!  Okay, so maybe that&#8217;s going a little too far, but as I sit here watching the snow fall outside, I can&#8217;t think of a nicer way to spend some time.</p>
<p>The Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket is green, with some tan-colored details.  It has a handy toggle on the phone pocket, to keep either cordless home phones or cell phones snug and safe, with no risk of falling out.  I also really like the handy clip on the front, perfect for keeping keys nearby, or for clipping on an extra tool. And the size of the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket is really ideal for both men or women: it fits comfortably on your hip, and lies flat, so you don&#8217;t get poked or stabbed with your own tools.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not drooling for spring already, you will be when you strap the Fiskars Phone and Garden Pocket around your waist.  Load it up with the goods, and you can almost feel the dirt between your fingers.  You won&#8217;t want to take it off&#8230;which is why I&#8217;m still wearing mine&#8230;</p>
<p>See where you can buy this spring-time must:</p>
